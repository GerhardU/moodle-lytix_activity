# lytix\_activity

This plugin is a subplugin of [local_lytix](https://github.com/llttugraz/moodle-local_lytix).  
This module was designed specifically for students. Its primary goal is to offer students a comprehensive overview of the time they've spent in the course. This module is accompanied by a counterpart for lecturers: lytix_timeoverview.
Students can view their own and of their collegues time spent in a Bar Chart

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract the files.
2. Move the extracted folder to your `moodle/local/lytix/modules` directory.
3. Log in as an admin in Moodle and navigate to `Site Administration > Plugins > Install plugins`.

## Requirements

- Moodle Version: 4.1+
- PHP Version: 7.4+
- Supported Databases: MariaDB, PostgreSQL
- Supported Moodle Themes: Boost

## Features

The time data is aggregated per Moodle activity. Anything not related to a specific activity (like quizzes, H5P videos, or BigBlueButton sessions) is categorized as "Course Time". The line chart offers a more granular view, allowing students to see individual activity times on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, students have the option to view the median time spent by their peers.
The data is aggregated using a scheduled task. This task retrieves all student interactions (clicks) for the course from a log table in the database.
