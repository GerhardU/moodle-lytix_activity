## Features

The time data is aggregated per Moodle activity. Anything not related to a specific activity (like quizzes, H5P videos, or BigBlueButton sessions) is categorized as "Course Time". The line chart offers a more granular view, allowing students to see individual activity times on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, students have the option to view the median time spent by their peers.
The data is aggregated using a scheduled task. This task retrieves all student interactions (clicks) for the course from a log table in the database.
